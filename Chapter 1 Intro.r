# Welcome to another tutorial in which we are going to study about how can we use R in order to enhance our skills in the data science field. It's a simple and easy to understand language which is similar to Python.
# This language is mostly used to create graphs using various datasets and here we are, going to learn how to do so.
# But first it is important to learn basics of R language!
# To use R, install R language from the browser, then install the R studio. If you are going to use VS code, then no need to install R studio, you just need to install the R extension in VS code in order to work with R.
# Let's start!

# First of all this is a comment. Comments are texts which are not included in the script file but can be used to write down some important texts. In R, just like Python, comments are written using '#' symbol.

# We use 'print' to print certain things on the terminal.
print("Hey there, welcome to R!")

# Variables are assigned using '<-', but remember, there should be NO SPACE IN BETWEEN!
c<-4
abc<-3+c

# Printing the result
print(abc)

# This was the basic information about this coding language and in the next chapters, we are going to learn about how can we plot graphs!
